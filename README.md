# One-Piece-Episode-Notifier

One Piece Episode Notifier is a program that will notify you with a Desktop Notification when a new episode of One Piece comes out; if you click on the Desktop Notification it will send you to the web page where you can watch the episode of the show.  
If you run this program with "pythonw" or if you run it in your "Scheduled Applications" setting in your settings menu you will be able to make the program run in the background and make it always run which means it will always notify you when a new episode releases for the show.  

This project was fully made and developed by ViridianTelamon (Me).
